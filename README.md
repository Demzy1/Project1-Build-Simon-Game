# Simon Game
In the Simon game, players are presented with a series of colors that they must remember and repeat in the same order. The game starts with a simple sequence and becomes progressively more challenging as the player successfully replicates each round. The game continues indefinitely until the player either gives up or makes a mistake. When either of these events happens, the player has the option to reset, by pressing the reset button.

### My Most Interesting Part of the Code
One of the most thrilling aspects of this project was integrating music into the game. Leveraging an app called Audacity, an audio editing tool, I recorded sounds from songs, then cut the parts I needed and saved them to my project's file. Below is a screenshot of the process.
